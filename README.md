# 🎧 Emotion-Driven Music Recommendation System

A deep learning-based system that detects emotions from facial images using a fine-tuned **ResNet50V2** model and recommends music accordingly. This project was developed as part of our final year B.Tech project in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

- 🧑‍🤖 Uses facial expression recognition to detect emotions
- 🎵 Maps detected emotion to a music category (e.g., Pop, Acoustic, Metal)
- 🧬 Model built using **Transfer Learning (ResNet50V2)**
- 💻 Trained and tested using **FER-2013 dataset**
- 📂 Includes academic submission files, proof documents, and visuals

## 🧪 Model Details

- Model: **ResNet50V2** (Transfer Learning)
- Framework: **TensorFlow / Keras**
- Dataset: **FER-2013** (7 emotion classes)
- Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization
- Output: Predicted emotion mapped to a music recommendation
